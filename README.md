RICK AND MORTY API KOTLIN APK

Hi guys, this is my study project.

At the moment 11.2021 I have been studying android for about 3 months,
and don't know how all applying technologies work in best practices.

But in my project they are working, and i like it :)

You can see:
- Fragments
- Splash Screen
- Recycler View with Pagination (PagingDataAdapter)
- Filters by Alert Dialog
- Room (packing objects by convert it in json)
- Retrofit (@GET @Query @Path)
- Using some coroutines

And if you want you can install it (rim.apk)

If you have any question or you want to applying some fix find me in Instagram

i'm glad to conversation :)
